\subsection{Criticity and impact}
In section \textit{4.1.2 Dead code analysis}, this vulnerability has been given \acrshort{cvss} score of 8.9 ("high"). This criticality is due to the critical service that the entity performs, such as creating identities (\acrshort{did}s). To give an example, it would be as if a bank (the entity) could not register new users. This loss of service would imply the loss of new clients, which could be a great economic loss for the entity in a real environment.\\

This vulnerability could also cause concern to the rest of the entities in the blockchain network, since they would find themselves working in an ecosystem that would not be safe.\\

Fortunately, this vulnerability has been found in the \acrshort{mvp}1, and the team in charge of correcting this bug has already been notified. Therefore, it will be corrected in the next phase of the Alastria ID model.\\

After the study carried out in this thesis, a series of improvements to the model, that are not within the scope of this thesis, have also been found. This improvements have already been notified and are being treated in the different Alastria working groups, such as the quality and structure of the code and the governance of roles, that in the next version of Alastria ID will improve.
