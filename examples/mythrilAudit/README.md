# Mythril Audit 
This directory contains the two scripts used in the thesis for static code analysis with the [Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril) tool.
- **_audit.sh_**: script that audits [Alastria's Smart Contracts for MVP1](https://github.com/alastria/alastria-identity/releases/tag/mvp0.1).
- **_getReports.sh_**: script that stores the audit results of the previous script and stores them in the "reports" directory.
